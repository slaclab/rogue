Welcome to Rogue's documentation!
=================================

Rogue is a SLAC Python Based Hardware Abstraction and Data Acquisition System. Look at our :ref:`Introduction` page for information about Rogue.

This is currently a work in progress and updated from the doc_updates
branch of Rogue. New documentation is being added incrementally over time.
