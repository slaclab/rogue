Installing & Compiling Rogue
============================

This section describes how to obtain and install Rogue. 
After installation is completed, consider following one of our :ref:`tutorials` to learn the basics. 

The recommended method for installing rogue is on Linux systems through :ref:`installing_miniforge`. 
If you chose to build rogue from source instead of using miniforge, the following list 
is the recommendation for each operating system.

**Note:** rogue installations are not currently supported on mac or windows hardware. 
A Linux(Ubuntu) VM or docker image will be required to build rogue. 

* Linux - :ref:`installing_full_build`
* Windows - :ref:`installing_docker`
* Mac - :ref:`installing_docker`
