/** The stream Pool class is responsible for allocating and garbage collecting Frame
 * objects and the Buffer objects they contain. The default mode is to allocate a
 * Frame with a single Buffer of the requested sized. Alternatively the Pool class
 * can operate in fixed buffer size mode. In this mode Buffer objects of a fixed
 * sized are allocated, with a Frame containing enough Buffer to satisfy the original
 * request. Normally Buffer data is freed when returned back to the Pool class.
 * Alternatively a pool can be enabled if operating in fixed size mode. When a pool
 * is enabled returned buffer data is stored in the pool for later allocation to
 * a new requester. The pool size defines the maximum number of entries to allow in
 * the pool.
 *
 * A subclass can be created with intercepts the Frame requests and allocates
 * Frame and Buffer objects from an alternative source such as a hardware DMA driver.
